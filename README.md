  In this project, we will apply the KNN approach to the Caravan data set, which is part of the ISLR library.<br><br/>
  This data set includes 85 predictors that measure demographic characteristics for 5,822 individuals. 
  The response variable is Purchase, which indicates whether or not a given individual purchases a Caravan insurance policy. In this data set, only 6% of people purchased caravan insurance.<br/>
